#Food Ingredient Manager

## Inspiration
As we were developing a problem related to food and agriculture, we were reminded of my experience working in a restaurant. The restaurant had a lot of guidelines for handling food safely, but it was difficult to communicate them to all employees, which led to problems at McDonald's and other corporate and personal restaurants.

## What it does
When we have a new ingredient or food, we can register it with a barcode. Once registered, the food information page will show our current inventory, guidelines for handling the food, where to store it, expiration dates, and more. You can also manage your food-related to-do lists. You can check off your to-do list and add new ones.

## How we built it
We used React and Node.js. The database is MySQL, and we haven't yet published the homepage and database server, so it's working locally.
